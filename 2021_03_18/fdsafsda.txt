Hi Alex, im answering your questions:

 1. ***Which U_Boot version do you have on module and how did you try to run an elf file?*** : *Im using U-Boot 2019.07-3.0.4+g26d926eda0*  
 2. ***Could you try to compile it to bin ?*** : *The compiler created a .elf and a .bin file, and they do not run* 


----------
This is what i tried: (2 methods)

 1. **Compile for Mbed Software** : By using this method i created a Mbed Project for the Software to detect  and compile, (like Eclipse .project file). **The problem** is tha when i compile it ask me to specify a TARGET MCU, so my best guess was to search for an MCU with the same Cortex-M4F. in the end i tried all of them and none of them worked.     (Probably for memory areas reasons as you mentioned).

 2. **Compile for cortex_m4_generic** :  With this method i created a file called libtensorflow-microlite.a
